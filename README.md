# SPNet
An experimentation project on Sum-Product networks for understanding the internal workings. SPN structure based on [SPFlow](https://github.com/SPFlow/SPFlow).

## Project structure
The file `node.py` contains the various nodes which can be used in SPNs. The SPN structure is created using object-oriented programming with each node represented by a `class` instance. This is not efficient, but helps tracing the flow of data through the network.

`utils.py` contains some helpful methods to be executed on an SPN.

`learning.py` ... TODO: Continue README.md
